                            <p class="project-description ">My second project was a weather app website that I developed after learning about APIs. With my newfound knowledge of API integration, I was able to create a website that provided real-time weather data to users.The website
                                was designed to be simple and intuitive, with a clean and modern layout that made it easy to use. Users could enter their location or search for a specific city, and the website would display the current weather conditionsTo
                                create the website, I used an API to gather the necessary weather data and integrated it into my website code.Building this weather app website was a challenging but rewarding experience. I gained a deeper understanding
                                of API integration and honed my web development skills. The project also allowed me to create something that could be useful to others, which was a great feeling. I look forward to continuing to learn and create more projects
                                in the future.</p>
